<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

This was primarily created to learn Cloud Firestore and Firebase Authentication with Flutter for a future project. It is now being used to experiment with Flutter Desktop. Over time I hope to create a polished cross platform chat experience, as well as add encryption to the messages. There is still a long ways to go, but with a solid foundation it shouldn't be too daunting of a task.
